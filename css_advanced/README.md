# SmileSchool Homepage - CSS Implementation

## Project Overview
This repository contains the front-end implementation of the SmileSchool homepage. Built as a standalone web page, this project focuses on demonstrating robust HTML structuring combined with modern CSS techniques to achieve a pixel-perfect rendition of the provided Figma design.

## Technical Stack
* **HTML5:** Semantic markup for content structure.
* **CSS3:** Styling and layout, including responsive design principles.

## Features
* Fully responsive layout across various screen sizes.
* Implementation of distinct sections: Header, Hero Banner, Quote, Video Tutorials Grid, Membership Tiers, and FAQ.
* Integration of custom fonts and imagery as per design specifications.
* Interactive elements (buttons, navigation links).

## Development Guidelines
* **No External Libraries:** This project strictly adheres to a vanilla HTML/CSS (and optionally JavaScript for minor interactions) approach. Frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap, React), build tools, or external CSS/JS libraries are explicitly excluded.
* **W3C Compliance:** All HTML and CSS files are developed to meet W3C validation standards.
* **Code Quality:** Files are consistently formatted, ending with a new line.
